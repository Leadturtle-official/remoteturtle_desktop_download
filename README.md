# RemoteTurtle Desktop App

The Windows desktop application acts as a secure and efficient gateway for creators to connect their mobile devices with the platform. Designed with simplicity and reliability in mind, the app generates a unique QR code that creators can scan using the mobile app to instantly establish a trusted connection between their device and the platform.

Once the mobile app scans the QR code, the connection is authenticated, allowing creators to seamlessly sync their profile, campaigns, performance stats, and affiliate link data. This ensures a fast and frictionless onboarding experience without requiring manual logins or complex setup steps.

The desktop app focuses on:
